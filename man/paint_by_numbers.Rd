}
\arguments{
\item{img}{Path (or URL) to image file}

\item{ncols}{Number of colours to select from image (if target palette is NULL)}

\item{horiz_res}{Desired horizontal resolution of output image (vertical resolution will be computed
such that the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained)}

\item{noise_reduction}{noise reduction (percentage of \code{horiz_res})}

\item{despeckle_passes}{number of times to repeat the despeckle operation (\code{magick::image_despeckle})}

\item{simplify}{proportion of points to retain (0-1)}

\item{brightness}{modulation of brightness as percentage of the current value (100 for no change)}

\item{saturation}{modulation of saturation as percentage of the current value (100 for no change)}

\item{hue}{modulation of hue as percentage of the current value (100 for no change)}

\item{treedepth}{depth of the quantization color classification tree. Values of 0 or 1 allow selection
of the optimal tree depth for the color reduction algorithm. Values between 2 and 8 may be used to
manually adjust the tree depth.}

\item{line_col}{Colour of boundary lines in output image}

\item{number_col}{Colour of numbers in output image}

\item{line_size}{Size of boundary lines in output image}

\item{number_size}{Size of numbers in output image}

\item{verbose}{Print messages (default = TRUE)}

\item{target_palette}{An optional target colour palette (rather than extracting colours from the input image)}
}
\value{
A list with three elements
\itemize{
\item palette = A tibble containing the colour IDs and their hexidecimal strings
\item painted_picture = The ggplot2 plot with the polygons filled in
\item cbn_picture = The colour-by-numbers ggplot2 plot
}
}
\description{
A bit of fun. Attempts to create a 'colour-by-numbers' picture from a supplied image.
